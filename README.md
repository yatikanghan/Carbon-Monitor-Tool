# 🌍 CARBON FOOTPRINT MONITORING TOOL

A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide and methane) that are generated by our actions. Reducing your carbon footprint directly contributes to global efforts against climate change, mitigating extreme weather and rising temperatures. Cutting carbon often means using fewer natural resources, and promoting sustainability in water, energy, and raw materials. Acknowledging and addressing your carbon impact demonstrates social and environmental responsibility.
